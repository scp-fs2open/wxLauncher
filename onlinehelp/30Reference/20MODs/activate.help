#Changing the active mod

To change the active mod, scroll the list and click the [mod][mod]![][li] you wish to activate. Two buttons will appear, one labeled **Activate** and the other **Info**. Click **Activate** to make the selected mod active.

To learn more about a mod, such as a description and links to its website or forum if available, select the mod and click the **Info** button that appears when the mod is selected.

<!-- **Note**: You might notice a yellow warning sign when selecting a mod. That warning sign means that the mod in question has some sidenotes provided by the author that are of **critical importance** and it's **highly recommended** that you read them before playing.

**Note**: The first item on the mod list is always the "(No Mod)" entry. Activate this in order to play the current [TC][mod]![][li] in its original form without any mods.
