#Welcome page
The welcome page is your first contact with the launcher and the first page you'll always see on a fresh launcher start. It's like your browser homepage.

Because of that, the welcome page contains two items that are essential to any FreeSpace 2 fan:

* [Profile management controls][profiles]![][li]
* [Hard Light Productions highlights][hlnews]![][li]

[li]: /images/li.png
[profiles]: 01profiles.help
[hlnews]: 03news.help
