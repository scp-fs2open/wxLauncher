###Connection type
In order to play on online, [FSO][]![][li] needs to know what kind of network configuration you have. Choose the apropiate value.

###Connection speed
For a smooth experience, select the apropiate connection speed here.

###Port
If you want FSO to use a specific [port][]![][le] when playing over LAN/Internet, type it here. Used for getting around problems with older Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewalls.

###IP
Same as above, but for the [IP][]![][le] address. Only version 4 addresses (the "classic" IP address - IPv4) are supported for the moment.  As with port, normaly not required, but is used to get around older NAT Firewalls.
