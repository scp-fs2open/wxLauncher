## Joystick options supported on all platforms

### Select joystick
This is a list if joysticks connected to your computer and recognized by the operating system. Choose the one you want to use.

**Linux and Mac OS X note**: If you connect or disconnect a joystick while wxLauncher is running, you will need to restart wxLauncher for it to detect the changes.

## Joystick options currently supported on Windows only

**Compatibility note**: Your joystick must support force feedback for the "Force feedback" and "Directional hit" options to have any effect.

### Force feedback
Force feedback, or *haptics* (from *Haptic Technology*) is a tactile feedback technology which takes advantage of a user's sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, and/or motions upon the user. An example of this feature is the simulated automobile steering wheels that are programmed to provide a "feel" of the road. As the user makes a turn or accelerates, the steering wheel responds by resisting turns or slipping out of control.

So, if you want to "feel" your fighter more closely, enable this option.

### Directional hit
When *Directional hit* is enabled, the joystick will bump in the opposite direction of where you were hit (by lasers, missiles, etc), but only if your joystick supports force feedback.

### Calibrate
Clicking this button opens the joystick calibration page in the Control Panel.

### Detect
Makes the launcher look for joysticks again. Useful if you plugged your joystick in after the launcher was started.
