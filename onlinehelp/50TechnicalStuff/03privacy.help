#Privacy: the technical details

As noted in the [FAQ][faq]![][li], no information is ever sent out that could endanger your privacy. Actually, what information wxLauncher sends is nothing more than a simple page request. <!-- **TODO which um kind of does endanger your privacy, at least a little bit, in that it notifies the server of your IP address.** -->

To get the highlights, wxLauncher asks for a [specially crafted page][page]![][le] that returns a list of the current highlights in a custom format. It's like a news feed, but with no HTML or XML, just plain text.

The result will look similar to this:

	New Blue Planet beam piercing effects by Komet and Wanderer http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?topic= 67663.0 http://www.hard-light.net/images/highlights/generic.png Ker.Soth has released a new mini-campaign for The Babylon Project. http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?topic=67320.0 http://www.hard-light.net/images/highlights/tbp-highlight.png ReeNoiP has released his 9 mission minicampaign Uncharted Territory. http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?topic=67327.0 http://www.hexellent.com/files/42/Uncharted.jpg Slasher puts us into contact with...  THE RELIC! http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?topic=67113.0 http://www.hard-light.net/images/highlights/tbp-highlight.png
	
From that information, wxLauncher will extract the necessary information to nicely display the HLP highlights for you.

That's it. A page request, nothing more. Your privacy is safe with us.

Remember that you can always examine the source code to check for yourself how wxLauncher works. <!-- It's worth noting that this is something you can't do in most commercial software. -->
